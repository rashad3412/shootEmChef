# üç≥ **Cook Em Chef** - A Fun 2D Shooting Game Built with Vanilla JavaScript

**Cook Em Chef** is a mobile-first 2D game where players control a chef that shoots at falling food items. The game is built entirely using **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS, and is playable on both mobile and desktop devices with either touch or keyboard controls.

## üéÆ **Gameplay Overview**

The objective of **Cook Em Chef** is to shoot falling food items from the top of the screen using projectiles. The game features increasing levels of difficulty, a scorekeeper, and fun animations of the chef moving automatically across the screen.

- **Desktop Controls:** Use the `Spacebar` to shoot.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

- **Playability on Touch Devices:** The game is optimized for mobile devices with touch screen capabilities, making it accessible on any mobile device with an internet connection.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game features different levels that increase in difficulty, as food images fall at random speeds and positions with every load.
